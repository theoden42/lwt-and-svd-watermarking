# DWT + SVD Watermark Embedding System

This is an implementation of the DWT + SVD based Watermark Embedding System which uses SVM for watermark detection

### PROJECT TODOS: 

WaterMark Embedding:

- [ ] Make a module to load and perform DWT of Image with coefficient extractino
- [ ] Generate Watermark module to the method mentioned in the paper
- [ ] Create Scheme to Embed Watermark in the coefficients 
- [ ] Perform the Singular Value Decomposition to obtain the final watermarked Image


WaterMark Detection: 

- [ ] Create a usable dataset with marked and unmarked images
- [ ] Create a new SVM based classifier to mark the images
- [ ] Test the trained model

Final Results: 

- [ ] Calculate PSNR and NCC values and final test results of the prediction model
